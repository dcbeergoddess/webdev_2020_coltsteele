### Introduction to Databases
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* "the most popular database for modern application" - Commonly used in combination with NODE 
* A **DOCUMENT DATABASE** which we can use to store and retrieve complex data from
- Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently and store it compactly
- They provide tools for easy insertion, querying and updating of data
- They generally offer security features and control over access to data
- They (generally) scale well

### SQL vs NoSQL Databases
**SQL**
* Structure Query Language databases are relational databases 
* Pre-define a schema of tables before inserting anything
* MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc.

**NoSQL**
* Do Not Use SQL
* There are many types, including document, key-value, and graph stores
* MongoDB, Couch DB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis
- **Document Oriented Database** | Document Store | computer program designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information (semi-structured data) | XML, YAML, JSON, BSON

### Why We're Learning Mongo
- Mongo is very commonly used with Node and Express (MEAN & MERN stacks)
- I's easy to get started with (though it can be tricky to truly master)
- It plays particularly well with JavaScript
- Its popularity also means there is a strong community of developers using Mongo
