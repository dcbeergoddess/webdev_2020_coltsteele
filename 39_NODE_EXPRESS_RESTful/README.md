### GET vs POST Requests
**GET**
* Used to retrieve information
* Data is sent via `query string`
* Information is plainly visible in the URL
* Limited amount of data can be sent

**POST**
* Used to post data to the `server`
* Used to write/create/update
* Data is sent via request body, not a query string!
* [EXAMPLE](getpost.html)
