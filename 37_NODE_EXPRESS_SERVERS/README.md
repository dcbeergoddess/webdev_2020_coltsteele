### Introducing Express
- A Framework
- "fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.JS"
- NPM Package which comes w/ a bunch of methods and optional plugins that we can use to build web applications and API's
- [EXPRESS GITHUB](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
**Express Helps Us:**
* Start up a Server to listen for Requests
* Parse incoming requests
* Match those requests to particular routes
* Craft our http response and associated content

#### Library vs Framework
- **LIBRARY**: You control the flow of the application code and decide when to use the library
- **FRAMEWORK**: control inverted | tells you where to plug in code | `inversion of control`
- `Ruby on Rails` = Framework
